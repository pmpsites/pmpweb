            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and  typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of  type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not  only five centuries, but also the leap 
            into electronic typesetting,  remaining essentially unchanged.
        </p>
        <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It  has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 
            years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at  Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure  Latin words, consectetur, from 
            a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through  the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the  undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from 
            sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33  of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by  Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on 
            the theory of  ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem  Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section  1.10.32.</p>
        <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced  below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de  Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
            by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914  translation by H. Rackham.</p>

                  "It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."

              </div>
        <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the  readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of  using Lorem Ipsum is 
            that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of  letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it  look like readable English. Many desktop 
            publishing packages and web  page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a  search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their 
             infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by  accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
        </p>
        <h3>Where can I get some?</h3>
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the  majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or  randomised words which 
            don't look even slightly believable. If you are  going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't  anything embarrassing hidden in the middle 
            of text. 

            </p>
        <p>All the Lorem Ipsum  generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as  necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a 
            dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model  sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem 
            Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,  injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
